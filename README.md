## Hi, I am Lorenzo! 🏃

🎓 I am an **Informatics student** at the **University of Pisa**, recently on exchange at the **University of Italian Switzerland (USI)**. As a Track and Field athlete, athletics official and sports photographer, I combine my passion for sports with technology to enhance athletes performance and fans experience.

🏃 I am part of the **Dual Career** program at the University of Pisa, through which I hold the status of **Student-Athlete**.

📊 I am particularly interested in exploring the field of **Sport Anlytics**, meaning data science and data analysis applied to sports. I want to understand how data can be used to optimize athletic performance, prevent injuries, and enhance decision-making for both athletes and coaches.

🚀 By integrating these advanced analytical tools, I aim to contribute to the next generation of performance-driven solutions in the sports industry. I'm passionate about creating sports-focused digital content, while also providing digital solutions such as mobile apps to improve clubs and athletes experience.
